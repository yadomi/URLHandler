URLHandler
==========

URLHandler is a very simple PHP class for handling HTTP Request in a RESTful way.

I've created this class to simplify my life when I need to create a simple API for some project I'm working on. In other word, this code is not foolproof and incapable of error.

Requirement
------------
- PHP >= 5.4
- Apache with **.htaccess** support
- Apache with **mod_rewrite** enabled

For informations about how to use it, look at the **exemple.php** file.
